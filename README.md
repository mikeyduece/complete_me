# complete_me

Complete Me is a project that was completed during Module 1 of the Back End Engineering program at the Turing School. This project introduced us to the concept of a retrieval trie. The program imports a list of dictionary words and allows users to enter a prefix and all words starting with that prefix will be returned. To interact with the GUI, open the complete_me_gui.rb file in Shoes.
